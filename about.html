	I primarily create drawings but I've recently taken up printmaking and digital media. I originally intended to work in animation. As such my work tends to focus on pop culture. I believe that even media that we typically view as shallow and commercial can have profoundly reflect things about our society. Nothing is devoid of some driving idea and I hope to achieve greater understanding of those ideas.
